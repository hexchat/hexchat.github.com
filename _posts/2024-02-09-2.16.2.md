title: 2.16.2, The Final Release
tags: [release]
---

This week 2.16.2 has been released. It contains some small fixes and features
that have accumulated over the past two years since the last release.

This will be the last release I make of HexChat. The project has largely been
unmaintained for years now and nobody else stepped up to do that work.

I want to say thank you to all of the contributors, users, and chatters I've
interacted with over the years. HexChat was a very important and formative
project for me; I started contributing to it as a teenager, learned so much,
met many great people, and it led to greater things in my life. It is hard to
let go but the time has come for me to move on.

I am going to move all data that I can to be hosted on Github, so all documentation,
installers, and dependencies will be there until the end of Microsoft.

Forks of the project are welcomed. Nobody can stop the code from living on.
